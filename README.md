# Overview

This project showcases a robust mobile first web application built using Next.js 13 as the React framework and
Tailwind CSS for styling. The combination of Next.js's performance optimization and Tailwind CSS's
utility-first approach creates a solid foundation for creating modern web applications. This
overview highlights how the project is structured to facilitate a seamless onboarding experience for
new developers and ensure code quality.

## Key Features

- **Next.js 13**: The choice of Next.js as the React framework brings performance benefits,
  server-side rendering, and simplified routing to the project. This enables faster loading times
  and improved search engine optimization.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The use of Tailwind CSS ensures consistent and efficient styling by leveraging
  pre-built utility classes. This approach speeds up development and maintains a unified design
  language.

## Developer Tooling

To facilitate an efficient development workflow, the project integrates several essential developer
tools:

- **Automatic Code Formatting**: Prettier is employed to automatically format code, ensuring
  consistent code style across the project.

- **Linting**: ESLint is configured to catch common code issues and enforce coding standards,
  promoting clean and maintainable code.

- **Type Checking**: TypeScript is adopted to provide static type checking, reducing runtime errors
  and improving code quality.

- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: The project utilizes Husky and lint-staged to enforce linting and testing
  before code commits, ensuring accountability and preventing low-quality code from entering the
  repository.

## Test Suites

The project includes comprehensive test suites for unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Jest is used for unit testing, covering individual components, utility functions,
  and API helpers. This ensures each piece of the application works as expected in isolation.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Cypress is employed for e2e testing, focusing on simulating user
  interactions and verifying the application's behavior as a whole. E2E tests cover critical user
  flows and ensure that the application's functionality is cohesive and reliable.

## Application Structure

The application consists of two main pages: the Home Page and the User Detail Page. These pages are
built using reusable UI components to promote modularity and reusability. Data fetching is handled
at the page level, improving component isolation and simplifying maintenance.

- ArrowLeftIcon.tsx: Represents a custom arrow icon used for navigation or indicating back actions.
- Boundary.tsx: Handles 404s for non pages.
- DetailsHeader.tsx: Renders the header section for the User Detail Page, displaying essential user
  information.
- Followers.tsx: Renders the list of followers for a specific user, showcasing their avatars and
  usernames.
- Header.tsx: Represents the header component that is common to both pages, providing navigation and
  other options.
- Image.tsx: A reusable component that renders an image with options like width, height, alt text,
  and priority for lazy loading.
- Organizations.tsx: Displays the list of organizations the user is associated with, using their
  avatars and names.
- Repos.tsx: Renders the list of repositories owned by the user, showing repository names and
  descriptions.
- SkeletonCard.tsx: Renders the loader used in Suspense.
- UserList.tsx: Represents the user list component used on the Home Page to display GitHub users
  with their avatars and usernames.

## Onboarding and Contribution

This setup provides an ideal environment for new developers to contribute effectively:

- **Clear Project Structure**: The separation of pages, components, tests, and configuration files
  ensures newcomers can quickly navigate the codebase.

- **Developer Tools**: The integrated developer tools foster good coding practices and offer
  immediate feedback, helping developers catch errors early.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust test suites empower developers to confidently make changes
  without introducing regressions.

- **Automatic Formatting and Linting**: The tooling takes care of code formatting and linting,
  reducing cognitive overhead and enabling focus on writing quality code.

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript enforces type correctness, making the codebase more maintainable and
  minimizing potential bugs.

In summary, this project sets a high standard for new developers by providing an organized,
well-tested, and developer-friendly codebase. The adoption of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and essential
developer tools creates a strong foundation for creating and maintaining a consistent and
high-quality web application. Tradeoffs Made: During the implementation, some tradeoffs were made:

1. Rate Limit: Considering the rate limit on the public GitHub API, it was decided to either mock
   the API response or use a personal access token to fetch the API. This decision impacts the
   actual number of API calls made during development and testing.

2. Reusability: To achieve reusability, components were designed to be modular and follow the
   principle of proper separation of concerns. Reusable components were created for rendering user
   avatars and user information.

3. Error Handling: Error handling was implemented to handle cases like 404s or other API errors.
   However, further enhancement can be made to improve error handling for a more user-friendly
   experience.

## Potential Extensions:

Given more time, the project can be extended in several ways:

1. Pagination: Implement pagination to handle a larger number of users and repos efficiently.

2. Sorting and Filtering: Add sorting and filtering options on the Home Page to allow users to find
   specific GitHub users easily.

3. Caching and Optimizations: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and optimize the
   application's performance.

4. User Authentication: Incorporate user authentication to increase the rate limit and provide
   access to user-specific data.

5. Scalability: Plan for potential growth and scalability by considering state management solutions
   like Zustand or a Postgres Database.

## Conclusion:

The implemented project provides a solid foundation for displaying GitHub user information and can
be extended to offer additional features and improve overall usability. The use of reusable
components, adherence to modern development practices, and proper error handling demonstrate the
beginnings of a system that will make future engineering efforts easier. As the project evolves, the
consideration of mobile responsiveness, ease of creating detail pages, and handling error cases will
further enhance its usability and maintainability.
